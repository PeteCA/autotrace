These are collections of "Question and Answers", originally posted to 
autotrace mailing list. Some of these are not "Frequently" but are worth 
to be known.

Q1. Using Windows you type autotrace -help you only see the last 25
lines, so how could we check that the user can read the whole help
text? (Martin Weber <martweb@gmx.net>)

A1. For NT-based Windows systems (WinNT, Win2000, XP), it's possible
to activate scrolling for the console window (DOS prompt). Just do a
right click on the title bar of the window, -> preferences -> layout,
and increase the buffer size.  This don't work for Win9x. I don't know
if it works for WinME. (Manfred Schwarb <manfred.schwarb@gmx.ch>)

Q2. Why configure checks pstoedit twice?
    
    First you are checking
    checking for PSTOEDIT - version >= 3.32.1... no
    and then
    checking for PSTOEDIT - version >= 3.32.0... yes

    why not
    checking for PSTOEDIT - version == 3.32.0... yes
    instead?

    (Martin Weber <martweb@gmx.net>)
A2. We have to detect one of the three states:

    1. We don't have pstoedit or have pstoedit older than 3.32.
       -- We should not build pstoedit output functions.
    2. We have pstoedit 3.32.
       -- pstoedit-config in 3.32 has some bugs. workaround macros
	  must be enabled.
    3. We have pstoedit 3.33. or higher
       -- The workaround macros must be disabled. I sent patches 
	  that fixes the bugs to the author of pstoedit. So the 
	  pstoedit-config in 3.33 will not have the bugs.

So, configure checks pstoedit twice.

autotrace.m4 has only '>=' version checking. It doesn't have == or >
version checking. (In other hand, PKG_CHECK_MODULES has such version
checking.) I don't want to extend autotrace.m4 anymore.  It will cause
bugs. (Masatake YAMATO<jet@gyve.org>)

Q3. Does autotrace could be built on MacOSX? (Many people)
A3. Yes. I tested on sourceforge's compilefarm.
    libtool shows a strange warning but autotrace could
    be built and run. (Masatake YAMATO<jet@gyve.org>)

Q4. Is there autotrace GUI runs on Windows? Is it possible to port
    frontline, gnome based GUI, to Windows? (Many people)
A4. There is no GUI that runs on Windows. frontline highly depends on
    libgnomeui, so if libgnomeui is ported, porting frontline to
    windows might be easy task. If you consider to write a GUI for
    frontline running on Windows, it is worth to consider using
    Qt. rob@mediasolution.it might have some interests.  Read the
    archive of autotrace mailing list.  I, the author of frontline, am
    using GNU/Linux only, so I don't have much interests in porting.

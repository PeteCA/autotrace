For Visual C++ user:

If you want swf support you have to get Ming at
http://www.opaque.net/ming/.  You'll get an unresolved symbol when
linking to the ming library with using Visual C++.  In Ming-0.2a 
shape_cubic.c has to be patched(shape_cubic.c.diff). Project files for 
Visual C++ 6.0 you can find in this directory(libming.dps, libming.dsw).

The patch is already reported to the ming author. The next version of MING 
will contain this patch.
